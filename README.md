# PixiJS Guides

The purpose of this project is to provide high-level, authoritative guides about using [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs). The concepts in these guides are generalized and shouldn't change much from version to version of PixiJS. If you're looking specific code documentation, view our [API docs](https://pixijs.io/docs).

## Building

To build the documentation locally, install all dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Then simply run the `build` script to generate the guides.

```shell
npm run build
```

## Development

To develop the guides in a browser, run the following command. Changes to the souce documentation will automatically re-build.

```shell
npm start
```
